# Web Service without Web Project
(well, almost)

Here we have sample RestEasy-based web service project without any "web.xml" and/or "webapp" directory.

It builds as WAR package anyway, but still usable as regular java app module.

The project is packed as EAR, exposing some Web Service endpoints.
